/*App Widgets are miniature application views that can be embedded in other applications (such as the Home screen)
and receive periodic updates. These views are referred to as Widgets in the user interface, and you can publish 
one with an App Widget provider. An application component that is able to hold other App Widgets is called an App
Widget host*/
