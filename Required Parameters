/*
Scaffold field

Implements the basic material design visual layout structure.

This class provides APIs for showing drawers, snack bars, and bottom sheets.

To display a snackbar or a persistent bottom sheet, obtain the ScaffoldState for the current BuildContext via
Scaffold.of and use the ScaffoldState.showSnackBar and ScaffoldState.showBottomSheet functions.

/*
Floating action buttons are used for a special type of promoted action. They are distinguished by a circled icon floating above 
the UI and have special motion behaviors related to morphing, launching, and the transferring anchor point.

Floating action buttons come in two sizes: the default and the mini. The size can be controlled with the fabSize attribute.

As this class descends from ImageView, you can control the icon which is displayed via setImageDrawable(Drawable).

The background color of this view defaults to the your theme's colorAccent. If you wish to change this at runtime then you can do so 
via setBackgroundTintList(ColorStateList).
